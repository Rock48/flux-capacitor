Discord bot mainly meant for role management. Allows users to add and remove roles from a selected list to themselves, with build-in tolerance for misspelling that is customizable to specific servers. Also has basic bot commands like .purge, .say, etc.

**.bestpony -** Outputs test message, meant to test if bot is responding

**.initialize -** Resets all settings for server, defaulting tolerance to 2 and removing all self-assignable roles

**.purge {number} [channel] -** Deletes most recent *number* messages in *channel*, or in the channel the command was run in if no channel is provided
        
*Example:* .purge 50 general
        
**.asar {role} -** Adds {role} to list of self-assignable roles, so users can add them with .iam
        
*Example:* .iam Not a Robot
        
**.iam {role} -** Adds {role} to user, as long as itâ€™s on the list of self-assignable roles
        
*Example:* .iam Not a Robot
        
**.iamn {role} -** Removes self-assignable role from user, if they have it
        
*Example:* .iamn Not a Robot
        
**.ct -** Displays channel topic in current channel
        
**.say {channel} {message} -** Makes bot speak **message** in **channel**
        
*Example:* .say lobby "Vapor Trail is best pony."
        
**.settolerance {newtolerance} -** Sets server tolerance to **newtolerance**, so users can misspell role names by **newtolerance** and still have .iam work
        
**.reset -** Resets entire bot in case of errors, can only be used once every five minutes
        
**.compare {string1} {string2} -** Outputs whether two strings are considered equal by .iam and .iamn
        
*Example:* .compare "Not a Robot" "notarobot"
